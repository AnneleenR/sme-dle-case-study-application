# sme-bi-case-study-application
For this stage of the application, we will ask you to create a screencast,  one corresponding explorable exercise for a specific portion of your case study outline and a wireframe for your entire outline. 

### Getting Started 

To begin the audition portion, **fork** this repo so that a copy of this repo lives on your GitHub account.

Once you have completed the following steps, notify Instructor Success with the link to your forked copy. Make sure that we will be able to view the repo using appropriate access settings.



### Step 1: Create an Explorable Exercise

An explorable exercise (EE) is a learning exercise an advanced exercise type leveraged heavily within DLE case studies. The objective of an EE is to provide the learner with a more interactive experience and achieve a deeper understanding of conceptual topics without being required to do any coding or utilize a tool.

 An explorable exercise consists of:

- The measurable **learning objective** that this exercise assesses
- A **context** that engages the learner and explains why they are doing this exercise.
- 3 - 6 bulleted **instructions**
- A **question** that assesses whether the instructions were properly followed.
-  An **interactive visualization** for the learner to utilize:
	- These visualizations can be generated from a wired range of sources and their complexity and scope is determined by the overall goal for the casestudy and question itself.
	- The visualizaton should require learners to complete 3-6 actions to uncover the answer


In our [Understanding Data Visualization course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/understanding-data-visualization), you will be able to find a many explorables that test a variety of skills. 

A few examples:
- [Adjusting bin width](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/understanding-data-visualization/visualizing-distributions?ex=6)
- [Ordering box plots](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/understanding-data-visualization/visualizing-distributions?ex=9)
- [Dual axes](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/understanding-data-visualization/99-problems-but-a-plot-aint-one-of-them?ex=6)


## :information_source: Read this before getting started
- The goal of exercises in case study is for learners to apply what was learned previous courses to new problems or situations. This is best pedagogical practice for retaining and building skills. Since the courses covered are conceptual, students will rely on manipulating the interactive visualizations that you create to practice their skills.

## Supported visualization tools for explorable exercises
The DataCamp platform supports a variety of tools to engage learners. Utilizing multiple tools is greatly encouraged but not required for a successful case study. Each technology has its own folder with more detailed instructions for you to submit your sample exercise.
- R with R-Shiny: Complete the `R-template` in the `Explorable/` folder.
- Python with Plotly: Complete the `Plotly-template` in the `Explorable/` folder.
- Tableau Dashboard: Complete the `Tableau-template` in the `Explorable/` folder.





### Step 2: Explorable Screencast

Screencasts are used in Data Literacy and Essential (DLE) courses to demonstrate to learners how to achieve tasks on the explorable exercise you create. They are **not** used in case studies, but will allow us to evaluate your exercise as you intended it. The idea is you open your sample dataset, give some background on the problem you are trying to solve, and walk us through the different steps required to find the solution. You can look at this [exercise](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/case-study-analyzing-customer-churn-in-tableau/exploratory-analysis-1?ex=4) for an example problem you can solve in your screencast.
 
 *Tips for recording the screencast: make sure the audio narration is clear and not too fast to follow. Itâ€™s often easier to first record the audio and then record your screen while listening to the audio.*

### Step 3: Create a wireframe for your outline

Now that you have created an explorable, revisit your outline and develop it further into a wireframe. The goal of this wireframe is to show how you can on linking the lessons and the exercises together to build a comprehensive case study. The format of your wireframe is totally up to you, here are some key points to hit upon when building

- [ ] Upload your wireframe to your platform of choice (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive) and paste the link here: 


Guidelines:
- When planning your exercises, remember you can utilize [drag and drop (Classify or ordering)](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/en/articles/3039539-course-drag-and-drop-exercises) and [multiple choice](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/en/articles/2375516-course-multiple-choice-exercises) questions in addition to explorables. However, each lesson should have at least one explorable.
- There are a minmum of three exercises following each video lesson.

For chapter 1 lesson 1:
- [ ] Explain how you will introduce the dataset and objective of the casestudy in the first video lesson.
- [ ] Summarize the learning sequence of your exercises for this first lesson. What takeaways should learners have from the first exercise that will empower them for the second exercise and enable them to understand the scrope of the dataset.

For chapter 1 lesson 2:
- [ ] Present how you plan on introducing the required concepts to fulfill the objective of the case study. You don't need to teach what these concepts are in detail, just present them so learners are reminded about their importance.
- [ ] Summarize the learning sequence for the exercises and provide a rough outline for planned explorable exercises.

For chapter 2:
- This chapter is where the case study comes to life. Each lesson should outline how the dataset is being used to progress towards the desired outcome of the case study. The exercises that follow allow the learners to either complete the steps themselves or interact with the outcome of the concepts and realize the associated value.
- Video lessons allow you to take the learners through steps that would be challenging to do in an exercise format and also allow you to demonstrate the impact that completing the previous steps had on progressing towards the outcome of the casestudy.
