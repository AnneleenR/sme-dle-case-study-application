# R with RShiny

## :information_source: Read this before getting started
- The goal of exercises in case study is for learners to apply what was learned previous courses to new problems or situations. This is best pedagogical practice for retaining and building skills. Since the courses covered are conceptual, students will rely on manipulating the interactive visualizations that you create to practice their skills.



## Creating an Rshiny explorable

#### Dataset

- [X] Add datasets used to the `datasets/` folder

#### Files

- [X] **R Source file**: Add your RShiny app to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `app.R`. Please ensure your app includes all the packages required so we are able to run it locally. The app should use the dataset from the `datasets/` folder.


#### Learning Objective

*One measurable learning objective that this exercise assesses*

The learner understands how visual data exploration can be used to answer business questions. 

#### Context

*3 - 4 sentence description of why it’s important to to do this task (linking back to the learning objective). Explain how this would be used in a real-life situation. Why is it useful, what problem does it solve?*

Exploratory data analysis is an important step in any data analysis. It can help to get a feel for the data and assist in answering descriptive business questions. Visualizations are often used in exploratory analysis, as they can summarize information and show patterns at a glance. In addition, it also counters the misconception that complex analysis or modeling is the only way to answer business questions. 

#### Steps to be executed by the student (max 6)

*Each bulleted instruction is a complete sentence that describes a specific task.*

- Step 1: Choose a statement to evaluate. 
- Step 2: Select the barrier variable to investigate. 
- Step 3: Select the grouping variable to be used in the visualization. 
- Step 4: Select the type of graph (optional). 
- Step 5: Read the graph to determine whether the statement is true or false. 
- Step 6: Repeat for the other statements until the false statement is found. 

#### Exercise question:
*This is a question presented to learners to check if the steps above were properly completed. It can be a multiple choice question or a question with a 1-3 word answer. It is often not possible to check if all the steps are completed, in this case; the priority is to check that the learner meets the learning objective.*

Which of these statements is FALSE? 

-Most employees with a seniority of more than 5 years, have not seen improvement in their workspace. 
-All employees believe their remote skills have improved
-When asked about poor management, the most frequent response for all genders was “stayed about the same”
-The majority of city employees don’t experience problems with their workspace 

#### End goal:

*Add an image of the final visualization here.*
